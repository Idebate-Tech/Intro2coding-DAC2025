# 📘 Day 5 Coursebook: Final Capstone & Presentations

Day 5 Coursebook** with the schedule removed and a clear submission process added for GitHub links or live demos:

## 1. 🎯 Objectives

By the end of today, each student will:

* Successfully **present** their project and demo its functionality
* Demonstrate practical use of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **Git workflows**
* **Receive and offer peer feedback** using a constructive format
* **Reflect** on personal growth, challenges, and next learning steps



## 2. Why the Capstone Matters

The capstone brings all your skills together—coding, design, logic, collaboration—while mirroring real-world web development. It builds confidence, credibility, and showcases your abilities as a developer.



## 3. Project Expectations & Assessment Criteria

Your final project should include:

* A **live demo** (via GitHub Pages, Replit, or a local link)
* Project files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Clear **Git commit history** with branching, PRs, and merges
* A detailed `README.md` featuring:

  * Project overview and features
  * Demo or deployment instructions
  * How to run the code locally
  * Future improvement ideas

Capstone Evaluation Metrics:

* **Functionality** (does it work fully?)
* **Code Quality** (readability, modularity, cleanliness)
* **Version Control** (proper branching and commits)
* **Presentation & Reflection** (communication clarity and insight)



## 4. 📋 Presentation Format (5 mins each)

1. **Introduction** (1 min): Project name, purpose, and motivations
2. **Live Demo** (2–3 min): Walk through key features and interactivity, showcasing underlying code
3. **Reflection** (1 min): Share challenges, lessons learned, and potential improvements


## 5. Peer Feedback Protocol

After each presentation, peers provide feedback (3 minutes total):

1. **✔ What worked well** – highlight specific strengths
2. **🔧 One suggestion** – offer constructive improvement
3. **❓ One question** – ask for clarification or deeper insight

The presenter then shares how they’ll apply this feedback moving forward.


## 6. Submission Guidelines

At the end of the day, submit your project by doing the following:

* Add your **GitHub project link** or **live demo URL** to a `README.md` located in:

  ```
  day-05/
    submission/
      README.md
  ```
* Include a short note (1–2 sentences) about what you’re proud of and what you’d like to improve next.
* Ensure the submitted `README.md` follows this format:

  ```markdown
  # Capstone Submission

  **Project Name**: My Cool Web App

  **GitHub**: https://github.com/username/my-cool-web-app

  **Demo**: https://username.github.io/my-cool-web-app

  **Reflection**:
  I’m proud of the interactive list feature. Next, I’d like to add user authentication.
  ```


## 7. 📚 Recommended Tools & Resources

* **GitHub Pages** or similar platform for live demos
* A template `README.md` with strong project documentation
* Visual aids (slides or screenshots) to support your presentation



## 8. Wrap‑Up Activities

* **Improvement Plan**: Create a short roadmap for your next feature or polish
* **Course Reflection**: Discuss in groups—what skills you’ve grown most, what you want to learn next
* **Celebrate** your completion and acknowledge peer growth


## 🎓 Final Thoughts

Your capstone is more than just an assignment—it’s your launchpad into coding! Submit your work, showcase what you’ve built, and take pride in how far you've come. Here’s to your next big project!

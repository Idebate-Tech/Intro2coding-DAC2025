Welcome to **Day 1** of our *Introduction to Coding* course. Today, we dive into the rich history of programming, exploring its evolution from early algorithms to modern languages. We’ll clarify the difference between coding and programming—and see how both are essential partners in tech.


## 1. Programming Timeline: Key Milestones

| Year            | Milestone & Why It Matters                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1843**        | **Ada Lovelace** writes the first algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine—the world's first “code” ([en.wikipedia.org][1]). |
| **1936**        | **Alan Turing** conceptualizes the Universal Turing Machine, laying the foundations of computer science .                     |
| **1940–45**     | **Konrad Zuse** designs Plankalkül, the first high-level programming language .                                               |
| **1949**        | Assembly language and Short Code simplify machine instructions for programmers .                                              |
| **1951**        | **Grace Hopper** develops A‑0 compiler/linker, paving the way for automated code translation .                                |
| **1952**        | **Autocode** becomes the first compiled language used on Manchester's Mark 1 .                                                |
| **1957**        | **FORTRAN** (Fortran Translation) launched by IBM—first modern high-level language .                                          |
| **1958**        | **ALGOL** influences all future structured languages; **LISP** created for AI applications .                                  |
| **1959**        | **COBOL**, developed by Grace Hopper and team, targets business data processing .                                             |
| **1964**        | **BASIC** created at Dartmouth for education; democratizes programming awareness .                                            |
| **1972–83**     | Emergence of **C**, **Smalltalk**, **Pascal**, **Ada**, and **C++** – foundations for modern programming paradigms .          |
| **1990s**       | **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Ruby**, **PHP** usher in web development and scripting .                              |
| **2000s–2020s** | Rise of C#, Go, Swift, Rust; **AI‑focused languages** like Mojo emerge .                                                      |


## 2. What’s the Difference? Programming vs. Coding

**Coding** is:

* Translating ideas into code using syntax.
* Writing actual lines in a chosen language.
* Focused on “telling the computer what to do.”

**Programming** is broader:

* Defining problems, planning structure, choosing algorithms.
* Includes testing, debugging, documentation, collaboration.
* Encompasses the entire lifecycle of creating functional software.

> As one redditor put it:
> “Coding typically refers to the act of writing computer code… Programming… includes problem‑solving, designing algorithms, and testing.” ([en.wikipedia.org][2], [timetoast.com][3], [newyorker.com][4], [reddit.com][5])

### 💡 How They Complement:

* **Programming** sets the direction—architecture, planning, logic.
* **Coding** delivers the solution—turns plans into working commands.



## 📚 **3. Why History Matters & How It Shapes Us**

* **Cultural Roots**: Recognizing pioneers like Lovelace and Hopper empowers us—especially women and underrepresented groups.
* **Conceptual Progress**: Early leaps (e.g. compilers, structured languages) still influence today’s programming innovations.
* **Tool Evolution**: Infrastructure from 2GL to 5GL reveals why modern IDEs, compilers, and frameworks exist—they are built on centuries of ideas.

We craft tools to help solve problems—tools that evolved incrementally, guided by lessons of readability, reliability, and reusability.



## 🧠 **4. Suggested Activities**

1. **Timeline Creation**:
   Build a visual timeline slide or poster using the key milestones above.

2. **Video & Discussion**:
   Watch the provided video, then discuss:

   * Why start with Babage & Lovelace?
   * What problems did FORTRAN or BASIC solve?
   * How did each milestone improve accessibility?

3. **Coding vs Programming Workshop**:

   * List real examples (e.g. “write a loop to add numbers” vs “design a login system”).
   * Discuss scenarios: where did planning impact your code?

4. **Reflection Exercise**:

   * Choose a pioneer—Lovelace, Hopper, Turing, Zuse, or Kurtz (for BASIC).
   * Write 2–3 lines: Who were they, what they invented, and why they inspire you.


## 📝 **5. Summary Takeaways**

* Programming evolved gradually: from mechanical math to modern general-purpose languages.
* Coding is the syntax; programming builds the systems.
* Every high‑level convenience (library, framework, compiler) stands on historic innovations.

By knowing where we came from, we stand on solid ground—and forge forward with confidence.
